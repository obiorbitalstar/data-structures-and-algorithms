# Stacks and Queues
## Stacks
Stack is a linear data structure which follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).
## Queue
Queue is an abstract data structure, somewhat similar to Stacks. Unlike stacks, a queue is open at both its ends. One end is always used to insert data (enqueue) and the other is used to remove data (dequeue). Queue follows First-In-First-Out methodology
## Challenge
Start a functional stack and queue classes that can add/remove/show data


## Approach & Efficiency
i created a function then tested if its working
i call it the one by one approach

hopfully the efficiency is O(1)

## API
### Stack
* push : adds a value to the stack
* pop : removes the last added value from the stack
* peek : shows the current top value of the stack
* is_empty : checks if the stack is empty or not and returns true or false based on that (true if empty)

### Qeueue
* enqeueu: add a value to the end of the queue
* dequeue: removes the first value in the queue
* peek: shows the first value of the qeueue
* is_empty: checks if the queue is empty or not and returns true or false based on that (true if empty)
