# Graphs
A graph is a common data structure that consists of a finite set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting them. A pair (x,y) is referred to as an edge, which communicates that the x vertex connects to the y vertex. In the examples below, circles represent vertices, while lines represent edges.

## Challenge
implement a working graph using python
## Approach & Efficiency
used dictionary for better time complexity

BigO:
Space : O(n)
Time : O(1)
## API

will be added late r
